# Honours Project

## TODO:

- Message St John about some questions
  - Information propogating backwards
    - Sofisticated Inference
    - Deep active inference
  - Creating a model of the other agent for the tranitions
- Read over VAE for the Deep POMDP
- Code up deep actinf mdp

## Draft

- Sections to be contained in final paper
- Skeleton of the literature review
  - Which papers will I be using

## Thoughts:

- Agents have no idea how the other is going to move. The encoding of this is done in the B matrix, the transition matrix. Currently, how the state of the agent is changing given its previous state is completely random accoriding to the other agent. This is where we would want to place some model of the other agent

- 2 blocks are illuminated
- Agents do not want illuminated blocks but to remove them they need to both be on each of them

If I was in their position what would I do / what would I think about myself

## Thoughts

1. PC
2. Hieracichal might not be neccesary
