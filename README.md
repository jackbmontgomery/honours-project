## Overview:

- The control problem - Cartpole - is doing nicely but is very noisy so I think I can do some slowing down of learning over the course of the episode to try and smooth out the returns
- The Bayesian Thermostat example is going to be a little different because i am going to try and test the model behaviour under noise so I can have some basic proir in the mapping but it will be nice trying to learn some noise

## Update:

- The next step in the implementation is to create a noisy environment
- Backoff the learning rate in the eta and maybe the step size too
- Bayesian Thermostat environment

## TPC:

- I am starting to doubt whether there is a need to modify A at all during execution
- The environment is only subject to change given u
