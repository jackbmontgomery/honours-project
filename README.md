# Honours Project

## Holiday Work Plan: 1 July - 22 July

**The goal for the holiday is that I would like to have implemented a multi-agent environment with the encoding of some collaboration within the generative model of an agent**

### Week 1

[] Complete [T-Maze Demo](https://github.com/infer-actively/pymdp/blob/master/docs/notebooks/tmaze_demo.ipynb) and [Cue Chaining](https://github.com/infer-actively/pymdp/blob/master/docs/notebooks/cue_chaining_demo.ipynb) Notebooks
[] Place 2 agents into the gridworld and have no interaction except that they cannot occupy the same grid space (cannot be in the same block)
[] Research and implement a basic RL / AI environments that will allow for specific communication among the agents
